# TatamiTilePlacer

This tool is to facilitate the level-making process of my game Amant. It allows me to quickly make levels with the help of shortcuts, quick-select menus to quickly select prefab tiles, and some quality assurance things. 

My game Amant is a puzzle game based around tile base Mouvement with another player underneath the level. So the tool needed to accommodate that by rotating the map 180 degrees to let you place tiles underneath the level. This enables me to make levels really quickly because it allows a faster iteration process for making levels(and I am going to need a lot of levels).

This has been done with the help of a tutorial made by Freya Holm√©r (intro to tool dev in unity series) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ45O2hg_30&list=PLImQaTpSAdsBKEkUvKxw6p0tpwl7ylw0d. Although, I have heavily modified it to fulfill my case.
